                            <h2>What It Is</h2>
                            <p>Video Descripion: <a href="https://vimeo.com/206533782">https://vimeo.com/206533782</a></p>
							<p>
                                TLDR: You have stuff to sell. But your life is busy; we get that. We sell your stuff for you - and even provide a pick up service to make things 100% easy. 
							</p>
                            <p>Schedule a pick up on our site, and we will come to your place and pick up your items. In the following weeks, as your items are sold, we take a % of the sale. We use different sales channels to maximize your profit including our own Shopify hosted store. 
                            </p>
                            <p>You also have the option to send items in the mail through  USPS. Monitor your items and profits on our online dashboard.</p>
                            <h2>What I Did (And Am Doing)</h2>
							<p>
								1. Created a Shopify store to maintain and sell our inventory. 
							</p>
                            
                            <p> 2. Led a 2 person team to develop a Django-based "seller" platform to integrate with Shopify. 
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>3. Co-Won the Venture Fellowship award, a $10,000 entrepreneurship award through the Informatics department at Indiana University. The award includes mentorship for 3 months in the Summer by a local Angel Investor, Business Professor, and another representative.</p>
                            
                            <p>We have a synchronized seller platform with the Shopify hosted buyer platform, utilizing Webhooks and the Shopify API. Payment integration so that sellers can cash out via Bank, Check, and Paypal.</p>
                            <p>We are trying to push our online store as we make initial sales through other channels.</p>

			<h3>Leading a Team in an Agile Environment | February 2017 - May 2017</h3>
                            <h2>What It Is</h2>
							<p>
                                For my "Software Engineering 1" class, we had a single project that was 10 weeks long. We worked in teams of 4. 
							</p>
                            <p>We were assigned "Customers", Graduate Students that represented real life business customers. We came to them with software ideas, and they came up with a set of requirements for a software solution that we had to implement. These projects ranged from a cooking video website, to a fantasy soccer website, to  a social media website.</p>
                                   
                            <p>Our team developed a platform called "JMatcher", a Tinder-like job matching site. The idea is to match you to a job based the best fit. This was a 5 2-week sprint project where we had to implement many different features. </p>
                            <h2>What I Did</h2>
							<p>
				                My team, (and most of the class), constituted of Masters students. However, I ended up leading our team in the archetecture design and development of our sofware solution.
							</p>
                     
                            <p> Our framework of choice was Django (Python based web framework), mostly due to my prior experience at developing web apps. My rational was that it is "batteries included", and is excellent for rapid development and prototyping. 
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>I taught 3 other people Django in mini classes that I designed. I also led team meetings in all 5 sprints, and assigned development tasks at each sprint.</p>
                            
                            <p>Specific features I developed are Employer &amp; Student User Accounts, Social Auth, Updating Profiles, Inbox, Live Chat, Heroku Deployments, and I also helped the out on Social Feed and Searching Jobs.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            
                            

                            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

							<p>
                            For the most part, this was agile software development where we met the customers every 2 weeks to evaluate progress and had daily scrums. In addition to the software requirements there were testing, documentation, and other project requirements. It was my first experience leading a team in software development.</p>
                            <p>We ended up being the top project in  the entire class. More impressively (and what I'm more proud of) is that we did this while spending (probably) the least amount of development time. We  probably spent 7-10 hours / week each on development &amp; project planning, but were extremely efficient!</p>

							<h2>What It Is</h2>
							<p>
                                A crepe food stand + crepe catering business! Serving late night outside of bars, as well as catering to private and public events such as Bloomington's Canopy of Lights!

                            <h2>What I Did</h2>
							<p>
				                With my partner, successfully catered more than a dozen events for various businesses and opened food stand during late night hours outside bars (we can make some mean crepes).
							</p>
                            
                             <p>Planned and established Crimson Crepes, a specialty food cart and catering business, utilizing crowd-funding on Kickstarter.com to raise $1,600.</p>

                     
                            <p> Oversaw logistics regarding finance and budget restrictions and management, professional networking, acquiring licenses, filing taxes, media and advertising, management of part time employees, maintaining a versatile and adaptable business strategy while reacting to unforeseen problems (such as a lawsuit from a large corporation, which was peacefully resolved) and other startup business aspects.

							<p>
                            Starting a business from scratch is quite a learning opportunity. I had to learn how to work with many people to get different permits, partner with businesses to get more sales, and learn how to cook crepes. Nutella + Banana + Powdered Sugar is my favorite!</p>
                            <p>Managing expenses, inventory, etc. that a small business has to deal with is useful for learning how to plan carefully. We also used power tools to make custom modifications to the food cart to make it fire safe and food safe (installing plexi class, air dispersion under the canopy, make-shift sink).</p>
                            
                            <p>We had a free food opening day that had over 150 people, and it was awesome! </p>
                                                    
                                                       <h2>Where can I get some crepes?</h2>
 <p>Sorry, we're now closed :( But, you can reach out to me and I might consider making you one! We still have the $800 crepe maker.</p>

                                A 6 month part time contracting job with Synergy+ Value Based Services. Employed to do all the market research, website writing / design / development, and digital marketing all from scratch.   
							</p>
                            <h2>What I Did</h2>
							<p>
								1. Created a Django (Python Framework)  website from scratch, surpassing all requirements set forth by the customer. 2. Providing valuable marketing analysis and a digital marketing plan, and implemented Google Advertising.                             
							</p>
                            <p>
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>What my research showed is that the healthcare technology industry is far too complex and confusing. Our goal was to appear sleek and simple, with clear solutions to definable problems. My website illustrates this point of view.</p>
                            
                            <p>My competitor research led me to formulate a customized Google Ads plan to track competitors, keywords, and conversions. At $10 / click on most health care keywords, the plan revolved around highly specific targeting. The focus was on iterative improvement, focusing on a geographical niche at first. </p>

                              The idea is to provide a platform for “offline digital content”. A wireless signal is broadcast which users can connect to. Upon connection they are redirected to a page in their browser.

At this page users can upload and share information anonymously.

Everything exists locally, disconnected from the world wide web. That is, you have to be within the signal range to access any of the content.

                            	<p>
								Created a piece of technology that could function as an isolated internet hub, a place where users can share information with one another anonymously.

                            <p>Sadly, I don't have a picture of what the final product looks like at the moment. I'm working on getting it.

								How do people interact when there are no reprocussions, no risk of being tracked or identified, where they can share anything they want unrestricted? There are many fun questions that can be asked and that can be studied from a  project like this. I pose more scenarios on the project website.

                            <h2>What It Was</h2>
							<p>
                                An 8 week internship at Cerner, a medical software company providing solutions to private practices and hospitals alike. 
							</p>
                            <h2>What I Did</h2>
							<p>
                                
								I Integrated a docker CI/CD solution into Jenkins deployments on DC/OS and Marathon, developing a python package to abstract and automate docker operations including building and testing, registry pushes, and marathon deployments.
                                
							</p>
                            <p>Well that was a lot. I used Docker to automate our CI/CD process for a few dozen Ruby on Rail's developers. Our "Population Health" project needed to be converted to be compatible with Docker - I worked on a small team to integrate this project with Docker and Apache Mesos (a container orchestration platform).</p>
                            
                            <p>Basically, I converted our web app to follow these principals: <a href="https://12factor.net/">https://12factor.net/</a></p>

                            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

                            
							<p>
								Dozens of Rails developers were able to save time working locally with a Docker set up. By setting up automating testing with Jenkins &amp; Docker, I managed to streamline the CI process with our internal Docker Registry. The package I wrote helped write more maintainable and testable CI code. 
							</p>
                            
                            <p>When I left, my team was in the process of setting up our CD process with Docker &amp; DC/OS Apache Mesos. I helped kickstart our initial setup and managed to push our builds successfully to DC/OS Mesos.</p>
